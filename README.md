# Fibonacci numbers/sequence

## Introduction

#### Knowledge of the Fibonacci sequence was expressed as early as Pingala (c. 450 BCâ€“200 BC).The Fibonacci numbers are important in the computational run-time analysis of Euclid's algorithm to determine the greatest common divisor of two integers: the worst case input for this algorithm is a pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers. 

## Usage

#### 1. Download the .go file

#### 2. Use shell/bash to navigate to the .go file directory 

#### 3. Build the .go file using the below command 
```
$ go build

```
#### 4. Use the built executable as shown below to execute

```
$ ./Fibonacci

```

#### 5. When prompted enter the desired integer for which fibonacci number needs to be calculated (e.g., 30 as shown below)

```
$ For what integer you need to calculate Fibonacci number? 

40
```
